# CPP-Blank-Project-Template
A minimal template setup with git and cmake for c++ coding.

This was based off of a game engine I am working on just to give a base to work with, but all of the names/libraries used/etc can be changed easily.

Made for my blog post (http://blog.globalization.seanbowers.xyz/2017/10/basic-new-c-project-setup-with-git-and-cmake/index.html)
